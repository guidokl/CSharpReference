# C# Reference Repository

A personal C# learning repository containing code examples, snippets, and experiments covering fundamental to intermediate concepts. This collection is built from various sources including coursework, books, YouTube tutorials, and self-directed exploration.

## 🎯 Purpose

**Note:** This repository serves as my personal reference and learning workspace. It's primarily organized for my own understanding and workflow, not as a tutorial for others—though you're welcome to explore and use it for your own learning.

This repository serves as a reference guide and practice ground for C# development concepts. Each project is self-contained with detailed head comments explaining core concepts, definitions, and method signatures.

## 📁 Project Structure

In Visual Studio organized into virtual solution folders for easy navigation:

| Folder | Category | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **00_Lab** | Lab/Playground | Experimental sandbox for testing |
| **01_Basics** | String Methods | String manipulation and method overloading |
| **02_OOP** | OOP Principles | Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals |
| **03_DebuggingAndExceptions** | Debugging & Exceptions | Exception handling and error management |
| **04_Algorithms** | Algorithms | Recursive algorithms and computational patterns |
| **05_Snippets** | Code Snippets | (Reserved for future snippets) |
| **06_Misc** | Miscellaneous | (Reserved for future misc projects) |
| **07_ProCSharp** | Core Concepts | Basic I/O, data types, and formatting (from Pro C# book) |

## 📖 Code Documentation Style

Each file contains **head comments** at the top explaining:

```csharp
// Concept Name        = Brief definition
//                       Additional details or behavior
//                       Related concepts or best practices
```

Example:
```csharp
// Polymorphism         = Greek word that means to have "Many Forms".
//                        Treating different objects as their common base type
//                        Objects can be identified by more than one type
```
